@article{Lamport-1977,
	Abstract = { The inductive assertion method is generalized to permit formal, machine-verifiable
	proofs of correctness for multiprocess programs. Individual processes
	are represented by ordinary flowcharts, and no special synchronization
	mechanisms are assumed, so the method can be applied to a large class
	of multiprocess programs. A correctness proof can be designed together
	with the program by a hierarchical process of stepwise refinement,
	making the method practical for larger programs. The resulting proofs
	tend to be natural formalizations of the informal proofs that are
	now used.},

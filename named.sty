% This BibTeX style has support for short (year only) citations.  This
% is done by having the citations actually look like
%         \citeauthoryear{author-info}{year}
% The LaTeX style has to have the following (or similar)
\def\citeauthoryear#1#2{#1 #2}
\let\@internalcite\cite
\def\cite{\def\citeauthoryear##1##2{##1 ##2}\@internalcite}
\def\shortcite{\def\citeauthoryear##1##2{##2}\@internalcite}
%% Call this macro before bibliography and after any
%% shortcites in the bibliography
\def\restorecite{\def\citeauthoryear##1##2{##1 ##2}}
